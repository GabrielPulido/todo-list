# To-Do List

This is a todo-list app I built using html, css, and javascript. This was to practice the basic front-end concepts I learned so far. 

How it works is that you can have multiple projects. Within each project, there are tasks which are milestones you want to achieve. Within each task/milestone, there are subtasks that are something simple and actionable to complete. Unfortunately it doesn't have localstorage implemented so the data is lost once the page is refreshed. The point of this project was just to practice using everything I learned so far.
